![image](ADCNet.svg)

## Project Overview

This repository contains our **successful replication** of the ADCNet model designed by the original authors. We have converted the entire architecture from TensorFlow to PyTorch framework, achieving superior performance compared to the original implementation.

### Key Achievements

- **Framework Migration**: Successfully converted the complete ADCNet architecture from TensorFlow to PyTorch
- **Weight Conversion**: Performed complex weight conversion from TensorFlow .h5 format to PyTorch .pth format for the FG-BERT encoder
- **Performance Improvement**: Achieved **89% test accuracy** (+2% improvement over the original 87% reported by authors)
- **Hyperparameter Consistency**: Trained using identical hyperparameters as the original authors to ensure fair comparison

## Deep Technical Implementation

### FG-BERT Encoder Conversion Challenge
FG-BERT (Functional Group-BERT) is a self-supervised deep learning framework designed to enhance molecular representation learning by focusing on functional groups within molecules. Developed by idrugLab, FG-BERT leverages the Transformer architecture to pretrain on approximately 1.45 million unlabeled drug-like molecules, enabling the model to learn meaningful representations by masking and predicting functional groups, trained on 44 benchmark datasets
One of the most significant technical challenges was converting the **FG-BERT encoder weights** from TensorFlow to PyTorch. The FG-BERT encoder is a critical component of ADCNet, specifically designed for molecular representation learning:

- **Original Format**: TensorFlow .h5 weights with specific layer naming conventions
- **Target Format**: PyTorch .pth state dictionaries with different tensor layouts
- **Key Challenges**: 
  - Tensor dimension reordering (TensorFlow uses different conventions than PyTorch)
  - Layer naming scheme conversion
  - Attention mechanism weight mapping
  - Embedding layer parameter alignment

The FG-BERT encoder serves as the backbone for understanding molecular structures and relationships within the ADC (Antibody-Drug Conjugate) context. Our successful conversion ensures that all pre-trained knowledge from the original model is preserved while leveraging PyTorch's advantages.

### Model Architecture Understanding

We conducted an in-depth analysis of the ADCNet architecture to ensure accurate replication:

- **Multi-Head Attention Mechanisms**: Converted scaled dot-product attention with proper mask and adjacency matrix handling
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Maintained the original transformer-based architecture
- **Custom Activation Functions**: Implemented GELU activation functions consistent with the original design
- **Regularization Techniques**: Preserved dropout patterns and layer normalization strategies

## Dataset Limitations and Considerations

### Current Bottleneck
The primary limitation of this work is the **constrained dataset size of only 435 samples**. This small dataset size presents challenges for:
- Model generalization capability
- Statistical significance of improvements
- Comprehensive evaluation across diverse molecular structures
- Robust validation of the converted model
- Creating Larger Model

Despite this limitation, our 2% improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of the PyTorch implementation and suggests potential for further enhancement with larger datasets.

## Future Improvements

This work will be further enhanced in the following directions:

### 1. Enhanced Molecular Understanding
- **Graph Neural Network Integration**: Incorporate advanced GNN architectures to better capture molecular topology
- **Attention Mechanism Refinement**: Develop more sophisticated attention patterns for molecular interactions
- **Multi-Scale Feature Learning**: Implement hierarchical feature extraction for different molecular scales

### 2. Accuracy Improvements
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple model variants for improved prediction stability
- **Advanced Regularization**: Implement modern regularization techniques (e.g., dropout variants, batch normalization alternatives)
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverage larger pre-trained molecular models for enhanced representation learning

### 3. Dataset Expansion
- **Data Augmentation**: Develop molecular-specific augmentation strategies
- **Active Learning**: Implement strategies to identify most informative samples for labeling
- **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Explore knowledge transfer from related molecular prediction tasks
